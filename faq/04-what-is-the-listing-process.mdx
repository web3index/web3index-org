- Reviews and voting periods are coordinated by Discord informally initially. The index uses a majority rule and each project's representative gets one vote.
- Projects that apply will be evaluated as to whether they have exposed the right API/data for the integration, whether their "fees" are captured truthfully and represent what people are paying to use the services of the network, and whether they fit within the initial "service/work protocol" category the index is focused on.
- There can be a loose description of what Web3 is, but ultimately it's up to the discretion of the existing listing projects to vote a new project in.
- Listed projects can vote to formalize these rules and processes or change them going forward.
- If you're interested in getting a project listed, check out the [README](../README.md) for instructions, or get in touch via [Discord](https://discord.gg/HrgU5ZtD).
