While The Web3 Index aims to ultimately track usage across the entire Web3 stack, it is initially seeking listings for projects that fall under the "service" aka "work" protocol category within the "middleware" layer of the Web3 stack. If you're unsure whether a project meets this criteria, check out ["The Web3 Stack"](https://multicoin.capital/2019/12/13/the-web3-stack-2019-edition/) by Kyle Samani to determine the category and layer of the stack it falls under. The index mostly adheres to the taxonomy described in that article. Once the index reaches 10 listed service protocols, it will move onto the remaining categories and layers of the stack.
