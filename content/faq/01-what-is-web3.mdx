Web3 is the next evolution of the web, defined by a set of open, trust-minimized, and decentralized networks and protocols that offer a range of digital services such as compute, storage, bandwidth, finance, and identity with no intermediaries. Run by network participants around the world, web3 unlocks cost disruptive infrastructure for application developers and provides users with a new set of guarantees never before possible under the traditional and centralized cost structures of "web2" applications. These benefits include:

- **Agency**: Own your identity, data, and reputation.

- **Interoperability**: Seamlessly switch between applications.

- **Infinite Scale**: No application downtime. Cryptoeconomics unlock [infinite scale](https://multicoin.capital/2020/02/06/infinite-scale/).

- **Reliability**: Guaranteed to run forever on reliable public infrastructure.

- **Money**: Built in money and financial contracts.

- **Security**: Safe, secure, and private.
