The Web3 Index reports on the demand-side fees being paid into web3 networks, which showcases real usage. Stay up to date on the latest web3 trends whether you‚Äôre a supply-side participant keeping tabs on in-demand networks, a developer interested in building on top of the most promising web3 infrastructure, or simply a crypto-enthusiast passionate about the web3 movement.

Unlike most indexes in DeFi (a category of web3) that weight listings based on market capitalization or ["total value locked (TVL)"](https://messari.io/article/how-to-interpret-total-value-locked-tvl-in-defi), The Web3 Index uses a [fundamental index methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentally_based_indexes). A key belief behind the fundamental index methodology is that underlying valuation figures (i.e. demand-side protocol fees and usage) are more accurate estimators of a network's intrinsic value, rather than the listed market value of the project.
