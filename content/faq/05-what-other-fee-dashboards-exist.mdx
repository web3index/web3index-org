Since launching in 2021, the Web3 Index has tracked demand-side fees across web3
networks to show builders, node operators, and enthusiasts which protocols are
actually being used. It is fully open source and community maintained, and
anyone can propose new listings. Since launch, several other fee dashboards have
also emerged that offer complementary perspectives:

- [Token Terminal – Infrastructure Markets](https://tokenterminal.com/explorer/markets/infrastructure)
  spans more networks and adds fundamentals like revenue multiples and
  price-to-fees ratios.
- [DeFiLlama Fees](https://defillama.com/fees) provides a free snapshot of fee
  capture across L1s, L2s, and major DeFi protocols.

Use whichever tools fit your workflow. Web3 Index will keep prioritizing
neutral, auditable metrics that the community can inspect and extend.
