Four months ago we [introduced The Web3 Index](https://web3index.org/blog/introducing-the-web3-index), a fundamentally weighted index for discovering and monitoring leading [distributed work protocols](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/distributed-work-protocols-web3-lpt-fil-grt) powering the burgeoning [ownership economy](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/) colloquially known as [web3](https://eshita.mirror.xyz/H5bNIXATsWUv_QbbEz6lckYcgAa2rhXEPDRkecOlCOI).

Today, after completing the process of analyzing and listing leading Web3 work protocols, we’re excited to launch The Web3 Index. The first six protocols listed include:

- [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/): Permanent on-chain storage of documents and applications on a decentralized hard drive for a one-off fee.
- [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/): A decentralized data storage network that allows users to sell their excess storage on an open platform.
- [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/): An indexing protocol for querying blockchain data.
- [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org/): The world’s largest provider of distributed video infrastructure.
- [Akash](https://akash.network/): The world's first open-source cloud.
- [Helium](https://www.helium.com/): A distributed network of long-range wireless hotspots.

A key belief behind the fundamental index methodology is that underlying valuation figures (i.e. demand-side protocol fees and usage) are more accurate estimators of a network's intrinsic value as opposed to the listed market value of a network's token. By putting these protocols through the lens of demand side metrics, The Web3 Index aims to become an essential tool for anyone interested in discovering and monitoring web3 network protocols providing fundamental value.

Are you a developer looking for reliable, scalable, permissionless, trust-minimized, and secure service providers for your web3 application? An investor who needs fundamental data to guide your decision-making? Maybe you’re an aspiring node operator keen to find a stable and worthwhile protocol, a delegator hunting for protocols that will stand the test of time or a journalist who wants to cut through the hype. No matter what your role in web3 is, The Web3 Index aims to be your go-to resource.

We look forward to a bright future for The Web3 Index, as it matures and evolves alongside the third evolution of the World Wide Web.
