# The Web3 Index

The Web3 Index tracks key usage metrics for protocols across the entire Web3 stack so you can stay up to date on the latest Web3 trends whether youâ€™re a supply-side participant / investor keeping tabs on in-demand networks, a developer interested in building on top of the most promising Web3 infrastructure, or simply a crypto-enthusiast passionate about the Web3 movement.

Unlike most indexes in the Web3 space that use market capitalization or ["total locked value (TLV)"](https://messari.io/article/how-to-interpret-total-value-locked-tvl-in-defi), The Web3 Index uses a [fundamental index methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentally_based_indexes). A key belief behind the fundamental index methodology is that underlying valuation figures (i.e. network revenue and usage) are more accurate estimators of a network's intrinsic value, rather than the listed market value of the project. In the spirit of this methodology, you won't see any token prices on The Web3 Index.
